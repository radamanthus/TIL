## Increase MySQL max_connections on EY Cloud

The default limit is 300.

To increase the limit on the fly, run this from the MySQL CLI:

```
set global max_connections = 300;
```

To increase the limit permanently, create the file `/etc/mysql.d/max_connections.cnf`:

```
max_connections			= 600
```

then restart MySQL.
