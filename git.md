# Git

## Clone a specific branch

```
git clone <url> -b <branch> --single-branch
```

From https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1778088/how-to-clone-a-single-branch-in-git

## Push an existing repository to Github

So that next time you don't have to go through the "Create a new repository UI" just to get these magic incantations

```
git remote add origin git@github.com:radamanthus/myawesomeproject.git
git push -u origin master
```
